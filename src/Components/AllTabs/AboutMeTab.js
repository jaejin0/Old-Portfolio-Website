      <p>Until I become 16 years old, I had been growing up in Seoul, Korea. And, I could have developed my competitive Math skills. Although I did not know much about English, but I was one of the people who were great at Mathematics. But as I get to come to the United States, I struggled learning English and adapting to the different culture, having a harsh time finding who I am and what my passion is. Once, I got interested in music producing during high school, I self-taught music theory, branding in pop culture, and how to compose.</p>
      <p>After I got into Texas A&amp;M University, during the first year of university, I had Entry-to-a-Major process, where students study in overall engineering fields and decide what major they want at the end of the year, just like every freshman in Engineering department at Texas A&amp;M. Since I did not have much knowledge in software and never did programming before, I was going to major in Mechanical Engineering. But I had to take a course where I could learn programming using Python.</p>
      <p>For the first week of the course, I was a student who did not know everything about the course. So, I had to keep focus on the lecture in extra amount. Whenever the professor teaches us about certain topic, I was busy trying every various way to understand the concept after the lecture. For example, when I first learned about types of variables, I put them in the parentheses to see if the conditions meet and how they respond in if statement. Fortunately, I could have succeeded the course well and wanted to learn about programming more. Since I also wanted to learn about circuits, I chose Computer Engineering as my major.</p>
      <p>After becoming a sophomore, I had a course where I could learn fundamental of programming with C++. Before course starts, I was expecting C++ to be as difficult as Python. I was destroyed. I spent my days in a library to catch up with if statements, loops, reading files, writing files, and pointers, but I failed to do so. I could write functions and make it work, but I did not feel comfortable whenever I code. So, I restarted studying from the beginning of the course and the fundamentals that were not even taught in lecture. I studied what does std do, what does #include&lt;iostream&gt;, #include&lt;fstream&gt;, #include&lt;string&gt;, etc.</p>
      <p>After doing all the study, I could finally feel comfortable again. I could focus on the lecture easily and finish homework much faster. And, as I look back why I could not catch up even I studied before, I realized the importance of understanding fundamental. I realized knowledges are supposed to be stacked up like a pyramid, to be useful. I decided not to try to rush to catch up anymore. I will look back at the fundamental and find what I am missing.</p>
